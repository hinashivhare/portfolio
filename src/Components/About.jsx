                    Hello, Iâ€™m Hina, a software engineer based in Montreal.
                    I love building new things from scratch and that is what I have been doing
                    professionally for 3 years. I am a tinkerer and that has always made me believe
                    that I can build anything I desire. I am very passionate about writing code
                    and bringing life-changing products to life. I am an outdoor person and I
                    enjoy riding a bike or skiing downhill during winter.
                </p>
